YouCast is a clone of the popular video sharing site YouTube. This web app allows users to upload, view, comment, search, and like/dislike shared videos.

## Technologies

* This site is built with React, redux, and Javascript for the frontend.
* The backend of this app is built with Ruby on Rails.
